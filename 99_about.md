# About me and my interests

![Picture of me](/img/alex-teneriffa.jpg)

My name is Alex and I’m 23 years old and I live in Kalmar, Sweden. Since earlier this year I’m a student at Linnaeus university and I’m enrolled in the program Development and operation of software systems.

My interest have always been computer related. A big interest has been editing (film and photo) and it’s something I like to do in my spare time. I’ve worked at different jobs since I finished high school (brewery, callcenter) and unfortunately haven’t pursued a computer related education until now. I have no earlier programming experience but I love it, it’s challenging but great.

Another interest that’s been consistent (well, for the most part) is physical training. There’s nothing better out there to release stress. Sometime I hate it and sometime I love it - but I need it.

Other than that it’s family and friends. I’m a competitive person so I love activities like board games, bowling and poker (basically anything that results in a winner). I don’t have the best win-ratio but I’m not a sore loser so that’s ok. 

*That’s short about me and some of my interests.*
*Hope you’re having a great day.*
